# WOWAddon_LetsGO
Usage: /lg

This addon will either dismount, mount, set follow target, accept summons and accept resurrects on remote player.
For mount command to work, be sure to set favorit mounts, it uses the Summon Random Favorit Mount.

Begin with opening the control panel by typing /lg

Enter the name of the  player character you wanna send remote commands to (this player must also install the addon).

Hit Save and the addon will check if the player got "Enable Receiving" checkbox ticked. 

You require a target for Follow command, select a another player (example: Yourself) and send the command.

Enjoy!
